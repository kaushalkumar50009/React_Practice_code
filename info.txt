    stateCity Array: This array holds information about different countries, each with a name, value, and an array of cities.

    useState Hook: The selectedCountryIndex state variable is used to keep track of the index of the selected country. It is initialized with the value 0 (which corresponds to the first country in the array).

    handleCountryChange Function: This function is triggered whenever the user selects a country from the first dropdown list. It takes the e event object as a parameter. The purpose of this function is to update the selectedCountryIndex state based on the selected value. The parseInt function is used to convert the selected value (which is a string) to an integer before updating the state.

    First <select> Element: This dropdown list displays the list of countries. The value attribute is set to the selectedCountryIndex state, which ensures that the correct country is pre-selected in the dropdown. The onChange event is set to call the handleCountryChange function whenever the user selects a different country.

    Second <select> Element: This dropdown list displays the list of cities based on the selected country. The options are generated dynamically using the map function. The stateCity[selectedCountryIndex].cities expression accesses the array of cities for the selected country, and then each city is mapped to an <option> element.

Regarding the question about the need for parseInt in the handleCountryChange function:
The value attribute of the <option> element represents the value associated with the option. In this code, the value is set to the index of the country in the stateCity array. When an option is selected, the onChange event provides the selected value as a string. However, we need the value to be an integer for the selectedCountryIndex state. That's why we use parseInt to convert the selected value from a string to an integer.

You asked if it's possible to avoid using parseInt. In this specific case, it's important to use parseInt to ensure that the selectedCountryIndex state is updated with the correct integer value. Converting the string value to an integer is necessary because the index is used to access the stateCity array, and array indices must be integers. If you omit the parseInt and use the string value directly, you might run into unexpected behavior or errors when accessing the array elements based on the selected index.
